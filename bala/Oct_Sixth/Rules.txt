ClassName: Should start with UpperCase Letter. 
methodName: should start with small Letter and follow the camel case
variableName: should start with small Letter and follow the camel case
CONSTANTS : All should be in caps
package name - package name should be small cases

Program should be well formatted

static variables can be accessed through static methods only.
If you want to call instance(non static) methods you have to create an object for the class.

Practice Examples: 
create one more inheritance example - Multiple Inheritance
Static and Non static - 
this and super keywords 


final keyword:

When we go for abstract class and interface

Create 2 examples of Abstract class and Interface
understand default mechanism in interface -  Example

Oct Seven:
Can static methods be overridden? YES but static functions are bound to their classes or interfaces (class.staticMethod)
if any method is common to interfaces and classes, classes take precedence.


Constructor:
Thumb Rules:
	1. Constructor name should be class name
	2. Construtor shouldn't have return type
	3. Constructor should have access specifier public(can have private for singleton class)
	4. Default constructor is optional, JVM will create default constructor for u
	5. But when you are having a parameterized constructor it is your duty to create default constructor
